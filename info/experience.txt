  - Created a microservice for text transliteration with a real-time testing interface.
  - Supports bidirectional Bangla-English transliteration.
  - Integrated into Food Search (15.3× more Bangla search coverage, 15.1× more order confirmations) and Ride Location Search (Bangla coverage improved from 78.8% to 96.2%, 17.4% gain).
- Developed a personalization microservice in Go for allowing users to have personalized user experiences across verticals.
  - Developed personalization algorithm for food home-screen restaurant collections, showing users restaurants that better match their preferences. This led to users taking 32.53% less time when navigating to checkout page.
  - Developed data pipelines with ETL to generate preference data and user profiles.
  - Enabled smart caching for faster data retrieval and lowered latency.
- Developed data pipelines for generating restaurant, dish, and cuisine features for the food search auto-suggestion system.
- Built a POC food search auto-suggestion microservice demonstrating feasibility and ROI.
- Built food search performance and benchmark dashboard for KPI tracking and system performance monitoring.
- Applied genetic algorithm to find optimal weights for internal string matching algorithms, which are used in address parsing service, increasing address parser area-level coverage by 2%.
- Enhanced missing place finder tool with new features.
  - Added multi-token support for finding missing complex place/road names.
  - Developed Google Sheets utility package for generating beautified address data reports.
  - Implemented rich email notifications for pipeline failure and successes.
- Upgraded address history pipeline to integrate partial orders data, adding ~2.7M new users' addresses and ~20M total addresses. Added custom date range support for address history ingestor.
- Developed driver location ping analysis tools with map visualizations.
- Created monitoring dashboards for ETL pipelines and ETL system health checking.
- Assisted internal fraud analytics and investigations.
- Regularly review and merge pull requests from team members on company self-hosted Gitlab.

Data Engineer I (Mar 2023 - Jun 2024 · 1 yr 4 mos) [Full-time]

  - Improved Chittagong’s within-threshold rides from 20% to 60%.
  - Built specialized ETA models for holidays (Eid, Ramadan).
  - Built comprehensive dashboards for monitoring ETA performance and debugging ETA related issues.
- Contributed as a team member in developing a robust address parsing service for courier operations.
  - Implemented an algorithm that uses customer historical data to perform address match and accurately parse addresses, which improved hub-level coverage by 10%, accuracy by 1.5%.
  - Improved overall accuracy by 7.5% which led to cost savings of ~102K BDT per month.
  - Built data pipelines for generating courier customer profile and address history.
  - Built dockerized ETL pipeline for transferring data from BigQuery to Redis with automated email notifications, capable of handling millions of rows concurrently.
  - Optimized data storage for Redis, reducing memory consumption by 72%, saving $120 USD per month per VM.
  - Created CLI helper tools for data validation, testing, and debugging, and scripts for automation.
  - Improved logger usability substantially.
- Developed a Python-based Bangla-to-English transliteration algorithm for address parsing. After integrating with address parsing service, improved hub-level coverage by 8%, district-level by 1%. (Overall, for addresses written in Bangla and English)
- Developed missing place finder, a dockerized tool for finding places data that are missing in our system, using natural language processing on user provided address data, finding 784 new landmarks in 2 major cities.
- Managed fraud detection systems for food vertical.
  - Developed and maintained tools for helping identify fraudulent activities in food vertical.
  - Maintained device connectivity system and assisted operations team with finding fraudulent entity groups.
  - Created dashboard for checking fraudulent user status and action taken against them.
  - Created comprehensive documentation for legacy fraud detection systems that were handed over.
- Conducted suspicious activity analysis to find possible DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks.
  - Analyzed traffic patterns and user behavior to identify anomalies indicative of DDoS attacks.
  - Applied machine learning algorithms to cluster users for identifying potentially suspicious user groups.
  - Developed tools for generating 2D and 3D visualizations that show user clusters and key insights for easier understanding and decision-making.
- Redesigned and implemented data pipeline for managing user behavioral data originating from Firebase.
  - Developed dbt data models for cleaning and transforming Firebase data making it easier to analyze.
  - Developed a session generator that can fill missing Google Analytics session identifiers.
  - Extended the pipeline to process data generated from different sources, i.e., Pathao user app, driver app, courier agent app, courier merchant app/web-panel.
  - Processes roughly 50–60 million rows per day (and growing).
- Conducted A/B test analysis to help stakeholders make data-driven decisions.
  - Performed A/B test analysis on user engagement metrics on 3rd party service providers, helping stakeholders make decisions to save $1,000 USD per month.
  - Performed A/B test analysis on Google Maps vs internal ETA identifying ~750K BDT/month (6K USD) potential savings.
